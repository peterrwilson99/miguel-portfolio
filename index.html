                    My main venture into the world of computer engineering began with my time working with the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Interdisciplinary Club (AUVIC). Collaborating with the electrical team at AUVIC has taught me crucial PCB design and modelling experience.â€‹

                    After finishing my co-op work term at Dometic (formerly SeaStar Solutions), my understanding of firmware and hardware integration has expanded. Performing system level testing on CAN networks has helped me understand the CAN communication protocol. Assembling multiple test benches has given me important hands on experience with micro controllers, multi functional displays, and actuators.

                    Personal projects done on my 3D printer have given me 3D CAD software experience in Solidworks 19. Experimenting with my Arduino has also taught me important concepts in simple control systems. While working with my Vex Robotics design team has taught me the real-world applications of microcontrollers, circuits, and programming.

                    I am currently working with AUVIC to build a PCB that controls the torpedo and grabber installed on AUVIC's submarine. In addition to that, I am helping AUVIC's electrical team convert the submarine's communication protocol from RS232 and UART to CAN.

                    In my spare time I created the Quadcopter System Solutions Team, a student made design team, with the intent to develop and build our own 3D printed quadcopter. As Hardware lead in the electrical team, I have led the team to design an Arduino based PCB that utilizes a gyroscope, altimeter, and RF communication chip.
